# Amazon price tracker for Telegram

This project enables users to track prices of products on Amazon and receive updates via Telegram. It uses web scraping to retrieve the latest prices from Amazon, and stores user data in a MongoDB database. This makes it possible for users to receive updates on prices when they are not actively checking the Amazon website.
